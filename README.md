## 1 Introduction (Contest-Related Excerpts)

[cite_start]Hierarchical design and IP modules are widely used in chip design due to increasing complexity and transistor counts. [cite_start]Floorplanning is crucial in VLSI design, providing early feedback, estimating chip area, and predicting interconnect-induced delays and congestion. [cite_start]Modern IC design requires fixed-outline floorplanning, as chip dimensions are determined early, making area minimization alone insufficient. [cite_start]Fixed-outline floorplanning optimizes space utilization and minimizes wire length within the chip outline. [cite_start]This also necessitates handling soft modules, which can change shape (width and height) to fit within the fixed outline without violating minimum area constraints.

## 2 Problem Statement

Participants must implement a fixed-outline floorplanner given:
* [cite_start]Chip outline width and height (bottom-left at (0,0)).
* [cite_start]Soft modules with names and minimum required areas.
* [cite_start]Fixed-outline rectangular modules with names, width, height, and bottom-left coordinates.
* [cite_start]Connection pairs and their two-pin net counts between modules (soft and fixed).

[cite_start]The objective is to minimize total half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) by determining the shape and position of all soft modules, while adhering to all module shape and position constraints.

### 2.1 Module Shape and Position Constraints

**Shape Constraints**:
1.  Must be a simple rectilinear polygon:
    * [cite_start]Edges parallel to axes, right-angle corners.
    * [cite_start]Intersect-free edges.
    * [cite_start]Single, hole-free enclosed region.
2.  [cite_start]**Minimum Area Constraint**: Enclosed area must exceed minimum area.
3.  [cite_start]**Aspect Ratio Constraint (0.5-2)**: Ratio of height to width of the smallest enclosing rectangle.
4.  [cite_start]**Rectangle Ratio Constraint (80%-100%)**: Module area divided by area of smallest enclosing rectangle.

**Position Constraints**:
1.  [cite_start]All module areas must be entirely within chip outline.
2.  [cite_start]No module overlap.
3.  [cite_start]Corner coordinates must be zero or positive integers.

### 2.2 Legal and Illegal Module Shapes

For a soft module (min area 20, aspect ratio 0.5-2, rectangle ratio 80%-100%):

| Module Area | Aspect Ratio | Rectangle Ratio | Legality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 0.8 (=4/5) | 100% (=20/20) | [cite_start]Legal  |
| 30 | 0.83 (=5/6) | 100% (=30/30) | [cite_start]Legal  |
| 20 | 1.5 (=6/4) | 83.3% (=20/24) | [cite_start]Legal  |
| 25 | 1.2 (=6/5) | 83.3% (=25/30) | [cite_start]Legal  |
| 27 | 0.83 (=5/6) | 90% (=27/30) | [cite_start]Legal  |

| Illegal Reason |
|---|
| [cite_start]Polygon enclosed area has a hole. |
| [cite_start]More than one polygon enclosed area. |
| [cite_start]Module area (18) is less than minimum area constraint (20). |
| [cite_start]Aspect ratio (10/2=5) violates constraint (0.5-2). |
| [cite_start]Rectangle ratio (20/36=55.6%) violates constraint (80%-100%). |

### 2.3 Calculation of Total Half-Perimeter Wirelength

[cite_start]Total HPWL is the sum of Manhattan distances between module pairs multiplied by their connection counts. [cite_start]Manhattan distance is the center-to-center distance of their smallest enclosing rectangles.

## 8 Evaluation

1.  [cite_start]Participants are ranked by total score (highest to lowest).
2.  [cite_start]Total score is the sum of independent scores for each test case.
3.  [cite_start]For each test case, the score is calculated using Equation (1) based on the shortest HPWL among all legal floorplans generated by participants, precise to three decimal places.

    $$\text{Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Shortest Total Half-Perimeter Wirelength}}{\text{This Participant's Total Half-Perimeter Wirelength}} \right)^2$$
   

4.  [cite_start]Floorplanning results must meet these criteria; otherwise, they are not scored or included in valid floorplans:
    * [cite_start]Program execution time (including file I/O) within 30 minutes per test case.
    * [cite_start]Results comply with "2.1 Module Shape and Position Constraints".
    * [cite_start]Results comply with "4. Output Format".
